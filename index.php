Need help let me know..  <br>
  To watch a channel on localhost you can watch channels directly in HD and SD <br>
  

<a href="http://localhost/hd.php?c=AXN_HD"target="_blank">AXN HD high<a> | 
<a href="http://localhost/sd.php?c=AXN_HD"target="_blank">AXN HD low<a> | <br>

You can change localhost to IP / Domain of your server if you want to watch on VPS <br> 
Regards
